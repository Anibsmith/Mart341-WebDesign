External CSS Style Sheet: The link element in the <head> section links the HTML file to the external CSS file (style.css), allowing styles to be applied from that file.
Class Selector: The .question class selector styles all div elements with the class question, applying specific styles like background color, border, margin, and padding.
ID Selector: The #faq ID selector applies styles to the section with the ID faq, giving it a unique background color, border, padding, and rounded corners.
Different Background Colors: The body, header, FAQ section, and question boxes all have different background colors to enhance visual separation.
Different Font Colors: The header has a contrasting white text color against its dark background, improving readability.
Borders: The FAQ section and each question have borders that visually separate them from other elements on the page.
