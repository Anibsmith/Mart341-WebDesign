Overflow: Applied to .review so that any text exceeding the box height will scroll, allowing for clean boundaries.
Border: A border is added around each review box to visually separate them.
Margin: Used around each .review to add space between each review section.
Padding: Padding is applied inside .review for spacing between content and borders.
Display: Inline / Inline-block: The image and review content are displayed inline-block for side-by-side alignment within the .review block.
