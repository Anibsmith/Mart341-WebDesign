Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?
      Web browsers are programs that use the internet to retrieve and display content. The browser makes an HTTP request to the website server when a user inputs a URL. The requested resources, which are usually HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, are returned by the server. After parsing these files, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) that depicts the hierarchy of the webpage. The browser creates a render tree, then uses JavaScript to determine the layout and paint the content onto the screen, enabling user interaction.
What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? 
      A programming interface for web documents called the Document Object Model (DOM) shows a webpage's structure as a tree of objects. An element, property, or text passage in HTML is represented by each node in the tree. Using JavaScript, the DOM enables developers to work with and modify the document dynamically, enabling features like content updates, event handling, and dynamic effects creation without requiring a page reload.
HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?
      The standard language for building web pages is called HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is distinguished by its loose syntax. Data is stored and transported using the stricter markup language XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which demands well-formed syntax. Combining elements of HTML and XML, XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) enforces more stringent syntax requirements while preserving web page creation capabilities. Their intended uses and syntactic rules are where the main distinctions lie.

What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?
      Each HTML page needs to have the following elements: a <head> section with metadata (such the page title and stylesheet links), a <body> section with the content that is actually shown to users, and a DOCTYPE declaration indicating the version of HTML being used. These components give the webpage organization and context. 
What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?
      A website's index.html page acts as its default landing page. The web server automatically searches for index.html to display when users navigate to a domain without providing a specific file. To make sure it is immediately available and acts as the beginning point for navigation, it should be put in the website's root directory.

Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?
      Use meaningful names for files, classes, and IDs to make their purpose obvious in order to maintain clean, well-organized code. Throughout the project, consistent naming conventions like camelCase or kebab-case should be used. Refrain from using spaces and special characters in names since this can cause problems with CSS selectors and URLs. Moreover, maintainability and readability are improved by grouping files into a hierarchical folder hierarchy (e.g., separating CSS, JavaScript, and pictures).
