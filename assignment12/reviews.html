                <p>This product has a lot of features, but the setup was quite complicated. I spent hours trying to figure it out, and the instructions were confusing. Additionally, some features seem unnecessary and overly complex for the average user. I would recommend it only to those who are tech-savvy and patient enough to work through the setup process.</p>
